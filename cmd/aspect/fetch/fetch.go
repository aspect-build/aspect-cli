		Long: `Fetches all external dependencies for the targets given.

Note that Bazel uses the term "fetch" to mean both downloading remote files, and also running local
installation commands declared by rules for these external files.

Documentation: <https://bazel.build/run/build#fetching-external-dependencies>

If you observe fetching that should not be needed to build the
requested targets, this may indicate an "eager fetch" bug in some ruleset you rely on.
