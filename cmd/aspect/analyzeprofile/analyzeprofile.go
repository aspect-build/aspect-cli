Analyzes each specified profile data file and prints the results.
The profile is commonly written to $(bazel info output_base)/command.profile.gz
after a build command completes.
You can use the --profile=<file> flag to supply an alternative path where the profile is written.

This command just dumps profile data to stdout. To inspect a profile you may want to use a GUI
instead, such as the 'chrome//:tracing' interface built into Chromium / Google Chrome, or
<https://ui.perfetto.dev/>.

By default, a summary of the analysis is printed.  For post-processing
with scripts, the --dump=raw option is recommended, causing this
command to dump profile data in easily-parsed format.`,
