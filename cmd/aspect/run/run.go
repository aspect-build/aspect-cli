Documentation: <https://bazel.build/docs/user-manual#running-executables>

Two environment variables will be present that the program may reference:
- ` + "`BUILD_WORKSPACE_DIRECTORY`" + `: the root of the workspace where the build was run.
- ` + "`BUILD_WORKING_DIRECTORY`" + `: the current working directory where Bazel was run from.

Note that the <target> may have an 'args' and 'env' attribute. The 'run' command honors these and
sets the arguments and environment of the spawned executable, unlike if the binary is executed as
an action during a build step, or is run directly outside of Bazel.
See <https://bazel.build/reference/be/common-definitions#common-attributes-binaries>.

'run' accepts any 'build' options, and will inherit any defaults provided by .bazelrc.

If your script needs stdin or execution not constrained by the bazel lock,
use 'bazel run --script_path' to write a script and then execute it.

By default, the program is run with a working directory inside $(aspect info execution_root).
Some programs expect to be run under a certain working directory, such as the workspace root.
Use the [--run_under](https://bazel.build/docs/user-manual#run_under) flag with a cd command, like
` + "`aspect run --run_under=\"cd $PWD &&\" //my:program`" + ` to use the current directory.
Another common approach if the program's code is in your repo (first-party) is to check for the
presence of ` + "`BUILD_WORKSPACE_DIRECTORY`" + ` in the environment, then change the working
directory of the process. You'd typically do this at the very beginning of the program execution.
