		Use:   "info [keys]",
		Short: "Display runtime info about the bazel server",
		Long: `Displays information about the state of the bazel process in the
form of several "key: value" pairs.  This includes the locations of
several output directories.  Because some of the
values are affected by the options passed to 'bazel build', the
info command accepts the same set of options.

Documentation: <https://bazel.build/docs/user-manual#info>

If arguments are specified, each should be one of the keys (e.g. "bazel-bin").
In this case only the value(s) for those keys will be printed.

If --show_make_env is specified, the output includes the set of key/value
pairs in the "Make" environment, accessible within BUILD files.

One or more of the following keys can be supplied as arguments, such as 'info bazel-bin'.
When no arguments are given, most key/values are printed.

    includes any remaining inaccessible memory.
