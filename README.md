# Aspect CLI

This repository will soon host the new Rust-based implementation of the Aspect CLI, replacing the legacy Go-based version, now in maintenance mode, which has been moved to [aspect-build/aspect-cli-legacy](https://github.com/aspect-build/aspect-cli-legacy).

## Coming Soon!

We're thrilled to introduce a faster, more powerful CLI built in Rust. Stay tuned for the release.

## Join Us at BazelCon!

Meet the Aspect team at [BazelCon 2025, November 10-11](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/bazelcon/), where we'll share more details about the new Aspect CLI. Training & Community Day is on November 9â€”don't miss it!
