title: Aspect CLI
---

The `aspect` CLI is a drop-in replacement for the `bazel` CLI that comes with Bazel.

# Why Aspect CLI

Every organization has a different engineering culture and developer stack.
Bazel was designed for Google's workflows, not yours.
Many companies have found they have to write a wrapper around Bazel.
This starts out as a small need to shim something in the developer workflow, and is often an
untested Bash script living in `/tools/bazel` which Bazelisk understands as a wrapper script.

Over time, the wrapper accumulates more code, and is a constant source of developer distress.

# Installation

## Homebrew (MacOS)

On MacOS, you can run

```sh
% brew install aspect-build/aspect/aspect
```

This installs the `aspect` command and also links it to `bazel`, just like the [bazelisk] installer does.

> We plan to have a standard "core" homebrew formula so this will just be `brew install aspect` in the future.

## Bazelisk (MacOS / Linux)

On any platform, so long as you already have [bazelisk] installed, you can have [bazelisk]
install the Aspect CLI just like it can install the standard Bazel CLI.
Add this to your `.bazeliskrc` in your project folder to install Aspect for all developers:

From the release you wish to use: https://github.com/aspect-build/aspect-cli/releases copy the `.bazeliskrc` snippet
into your `.bazeliskrc` file to install Aspect for all developers in this repository.

Note that in all cases, the `.bazelversion` file continues to indicate which version of the
Bazel tool is fetched and run beneath the wrapper.

## Manual (MacOS / Linux)

On any platform, you can download the `aspect` binary for your platform on our
[Releases](https://github.com/aspect-build/aspect-cli/releases) page and add it to your `PATH` manually.

Note, if you manually install for MacOS, you can bypass the "Unknown Developer" dialog by running
`xattr -c $(which aspect)` before launching `aspect`.

## Windows

Windows releases are no longer published as of [v5.5.0](https://github.com/aspect-build/aspect-cli/releases/tag/5.5.0).
This is due to a new dependency on [go-tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-go)
which has a CGO dependency that makes cross compiling to Windows difficult.

To produce Windows releases will require some engineering work to resolve the CGO cross compilation issues.
Please let us know if you require a Windows Aspect CLI binary.
In the meantime, we recommend using WSL2 on Windows.

# Usage

Just run `aspect help` to see the available commands.
Some are the standard ones you know from Bazel, and others are new, such as `print` and `docs`.

## Write a plugin

Aspect's plugin system allows you to fit Bazel into your team's development process,
with custom commands, behaviors, and integrations.

A plugin is any program (written in any language) that serves our gRPC protocol.
The easiest way to get started is to clone our
[starter template repo](https://github.com/aspect-build/aspect-cli-plugin-template).

See the [Plugin Documentation](./plugins.md) for more information on how to write a plugin.
