## Install Aspect CLI OSS

See full install instructions in [README.md](https://github.com/aspect-build/aspect-cli/blob/${TAG}/README.md).

### Bazelisk (MacOS / Linux)

Configure [bazelisk](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk) to use the Aspect CLI OSS for all developers in a repository
by adding the following to \`.bazeliskrc\` in the repository root:

\`\`\`
BAZELISK_BASE_URL=https://github.com/aspect-build/aspect-cli/releases/download
USE_BAZEL_VERSION=aspect/${TAG}
\`\`\`

> [!NOTE]
> This approach doesn't provide the \`aspect init\` command, which has to run outside a Bazel workspace.

The underlying version of Bazel can be configured in your \`.bazelversion\` file or the \`BAZEL_VERSION\` environment variable.
