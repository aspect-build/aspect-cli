## aspect build

Build the specified targets

### Synopsis

Performs a build on the specified targets, producing their default outputs.

Documentation: <https://bazel.build/run/build#bazel-build>

Run 'aspect help target-syntax' for details and examples on how to specify targets to build.

Commonly used flags
-------------------

Bazel will first fetch any missing or out-of-date external dependencies.
You can run build with `--fetch=false` to inhibit this.
See 'aspect help fetch' for more information.

Since Bazel has no analyze command, you can use `build --nobuild` to only load and analyze
BUILD files without spawning any build actions. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/15318

The build will halt as soon as the first error is encountered. Use `--keep_going (-k)` to
continue building.

Note that the rule implementation(s) may only run a subset of their actions to produce the default
outputs of the requested targets.
To create non-default outputs, consider using the `--output_groups` flag.

The target pattern may be further filtered using the flag
[--build_tag_filters](https://bazel.build/reference/command-line-reference#flag--build_tag_filters)
