# Plugin catalog

This is a registry where users can list their Aspect CLI plugins.
You can view the live catalog at <https://docs.aspect.build/plugins>.

## Contributing

Add your plugin to the `plugins.json` file and send us a PR.

Our CI will validate your changes against the `plugins.schema.json`.

After our next CLI release, we update the documentation site and then your plugin will appear.
