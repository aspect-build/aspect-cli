## aspect dump

Dumps the internal state of the bazel server process.

### Synopsis

Dumps the internal state of the bazel server process.

This command is provided as an aid to debugging, not as a stable interface, so
users should not try to parse the output; instead, use 'query' or 'info' for
this purpose.
