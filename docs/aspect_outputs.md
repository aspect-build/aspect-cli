## aspect outputs

Print paths to declared output files

### Synopsis

Queries for the outputs declared by actions generated by the given target.

Prints each output file on a line, with the mnemonic of the action that produces it,
followed by a path to the file, relative to the workspace root.

You can optionally provide an extra argument, which is a filter on the mnemonic.

```
aspect outputs <target> [mnemonic] [flags]
```
