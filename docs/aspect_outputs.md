## aspect outputs

Print paths to declared output files

### Synopsis

Queries for the outputs declared by actions generated by the given target or the target(s) in the given query expression.
 
Prints each output file on a line, with the mnemonic of the action that produces it,
followed by a path to the file, relative to the workspace root.

You can optionally provide an extra argument, which is a filter on the mnemonic.

'ExecutableHash' is a special value for the mnemonic. This combines the ExecutableSymlink and
SourceSymlinkManifest mnemonics, then hashes the outputs of these two. This provides a good hash
for an executable target to determine if it has changed.

```
aspect outputs <expression> [mnemonic] [flags]
```

### Examples

```
# Show all outputs of the //cli/core target, which is a go_binary:

% aspect outputs //cli/core

GoCompilePkg bazel-out/k8-fastbuild/bin/cli/core/core.a
GoCompilePkg bazel-out/k8-fastbuild/bin/cli/core/core.x
GoLink bazel-out/k8-fastbuild/bin/cli/core/core_/core
SourceSymlinkManifest bazel-out/k8-fastbuild/bin/cli/core/core_/core.runfiles_manifest
SymlinkTree bazel-out/k8-fastbuild/bin/cli/core/core_/core.runfiles/MANIFEST
Middleman bazel-out/k8-fastbuild/internal/_middlemen/cli_Spro_Spro_U_Spro-runfiles

# Show just the output of the GoLink action, which is the executable produced by a go_binary:

% aspect outputs //cli/core GoLink
bazel-out/k8-fastbuild/bin/cli/core/core_/core

# Show the outputs of all targets that contain the 'deliverable' tag

% aspect outputs 'attr("tags", "\bdeliverable\b", //...)'

ExecutableSymlink bazel-out/darwin-fastbuild/bin/cli/release
SourceSymlinkManifest bazel-out/darwin-fastbuild/bin/cli/release.runfiles_manifest
SymlinkTree bazel-out/darwin-fastbuild/bin/cli/release.runfiles/MANIFEST
Middleman bazel-out/darwin-fastbuild/internal/_middlemen/cli_Srelease-runfiles
```

### Options

```
      --hash_salt string   When 'ExecutableHash' is specified, this value will be added as a suffix to every hash
  -h, --help               help for outputs
