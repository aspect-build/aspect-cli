# Kotlin Gazelle Extension

EXPERIMENTAL: This is a work in progress and is not yet ready for use. Work is ongoing including upcoming support for rules_jvm maven dependencies.

This is a [Gazelle](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle) `Language` implementation for Kotlin using the [rules_kotlin](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_kotlin) `jvm` rules.
