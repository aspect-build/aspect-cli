gazelle: Failed to validate dependencies for target "@validate_import_statements//:validate_import_statements":

Import "bad-import" from "main.ts" is an unknown dependency. Possible solutions:
	1. Instruct Gazelle to resolve to a known dependency using the gazelle:resolve directive.
	2. Ignore the dependency using the '# gazelle:js_ignore_imports bad-import' directive.
	3. Disable Gazelle resolution validation using '# gazelle:js_validate_import_statements false'

Import "bad-import2" from "main.ts" is an unknown dependency. Possible solutions:
	1. Instruct Gazelle to resolve to a known dependency using the gazelle:resolve directive.
	2. Ignore the dependency using the '# gazelle:js_ignore_imports bad-import2' directive.
	3. Disable Gazelle resolution validation using '# gazelle:js_validate_import_statements false'
