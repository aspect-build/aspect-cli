Source rule generation error: failed to generate target "//:rules_conflicting_name" of kind "ts_project": a target of kind "filegroup" with the same name already exists. Use the '# aspect:js_project_naming_convention' directive to change the naming convention.

For example:
	# aspect:js_project_naming_convention {dirname}_js
	# aspect:js_tests_naming_convention {dirname}_js_tests
